# AguilarFMiniChallenge3
I recreated mini challenge 3 where we ask two questions. Taking the answers from the two questions and displaying the answers on the console.
Adding in data validation to ensure user inputs an appropriate response.

Peer Reviewed By: Isaiah Ferguson - the Code runs and loop work well, i really like the questions they are super funny! i would add another loop if the second input name or costume option is also a number. but overall a good program!
